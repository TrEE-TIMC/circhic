CircHiC: Easy plotting of circular bacterial data
=================================================

Genome wide contact frequencies obtained using HiC-like experiments have
raised novel challenges in terms of visualization and rationalization of
chromosome structuring phenomena. In bacteria, one difficulty consists in
displaying data in a way that is congruent with the circularity of
chromosomes. Standard representations of HiC data under the form of square
matrices or horizontal bands are indeed not adapted to periodic conditions as
those imposed by (most) bacterial chromosomes. Here, we fill this gap and
propose a Python library, built upon the widely used Matplotlib library, to
display such data in circular strips together with the possibility to overlay
genomic data (plots and heat maps). The proposed tools are light and fast,
aiming to facilitate the exploration and understanding of bacterial chromosome
structuring data.
